        		What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.

        		Some of the most notable accomplishments of Mother Teresa
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>She received the Nobel Peace Prize for her humanitarian work in 1979/li>
        		<li>She created homes for the dying and unwanted in Calcutta, New York, and Albania</li>
        		<li>In 1950 she founded the Missionaries of Charity to give free services to the poor</li>
        		<li>She aided in relief efforts for those dying from Leprosy</li>
    
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		Over the last 100 years no man exemplifies these values for me more than Martin Luther King. He called people to be accountable for the racial prejudices that we all carry. He demonstrated that violence is not the best way to create lasting change. And throughout his life he sacrificed everything to make the world better.
